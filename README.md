The Svoboda Diaries project at the University of Washington has produced transcriptions of 19th century English-language diaries of Joseph Mathia Svoboda from the 1860s to 1920s as well as an Arabic-language travel journal of Alexander Svoboda. 

They write "Our first publishing project has been the Alexander Svoboda Travel Journal. On the 15th of April, 1897, a 19 year-old European resident of Baghdad, named Alexander Richard Svoboda, set out on a long journey to Europe by caravan, boat and train. From a large and influential family of merchants, artists, and explorers settled in Ottoman Iraq since the end of the 18th century, Alexander traveled in the company of his parents and a departing British diplomat accompanied by his retinue. They followed a circuitous route through the Middle East to Cairo and thence to Europe on a three and a half month journey which Alexander described day-by-day in a journal written in the Iraqi Arabic of his time."

The various materials from the Alexander Svoboda travel journal can be found [here](https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/handle/1773/37334) including a pdf of the Arabic publication along with other publication formats. 

The successive pages of the API are not in sequential order of the journal.  We used the csv file in this repository, Svoboda_AR_URL_map.csv, in order to scrape the images. 

page_journal is the page in the archival document written in Arabic-Hindi letters. page_docx is the page on which the edition is found [here](http://hdl.handle.net/1773/37656). 

We will use these to build a handwritten model for Transkribus.
